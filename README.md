# Weather Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict whether it will rain tomorrow or not based on various weather attributes with exploration on dataset. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the "Weather Dataset - Rattle Package" available on Kaggle.

## Contents

- `Weather_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction code.
- `weatherAUS.csv`: Dataset file containing historical weather data.
- `README.md`: Documentation providing an overview of the project, instructions for usage, and any additional information.

## Requirements

- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd Weather_Prediction
    ```

3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook:

    ```
    jupyter notebook Weather_Prediction.ipynb
    ```

4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to perform EDA, train models, and make predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations. Each row represents a single day, and the columns include various attributes such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.

## Models Used

1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. Random Forest Classifier

## Results

The models were evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy and precision. The performance of each model is discussed in detail within the Jupyter notebook.
